# Placement magazine

*Fri, 29 Sep 2000*

LBS' placement cell publishes a magazine called Target, some of whose pages I've scanned. It gives an idea about what consulting and finance is, what companies look for, how to prepare for interviews, alumni feedback, etc. Sorry about the small size of scanning, but I had to conserve disk space. I'll bring the book to IIM-B when I come back.

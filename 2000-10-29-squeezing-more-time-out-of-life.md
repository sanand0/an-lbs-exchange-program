# Squeezing more time out of life

*Sun, 29 Oct 2000*

Sheer laziness kept me in bed till 9:30AM. Then I got dressed, and logged on to the computer, only to be greeted with "I've set the clock an hour behind, because it's Daylight Saving Time. Check if it's OK." or something like that. Neat! I truly got an extra hour. I mean, I actually did something useful. So I told Ashwin (an exchange student from UCLA) that I'd gained an hour of life.

Ashwin: "But then, you'll lose it when the time changes back..."

Me: "No, because I'll be in India by then."

Ashwin: "Hmm.... something wrong there."

Me: "And I can do this for ever -- just spending winters in London!"

Took us a while to figure out that we'd be losing time when we were on the flight. But neither of us seemed to mind.

There's a gale warning. Now, the weather's cold enough as it is. Wonder what a gale's going to do to it.
